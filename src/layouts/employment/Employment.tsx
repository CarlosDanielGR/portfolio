        As a responsible individual for providing support to the company's
        current projects and developing new projects from design to
        implementation, I apply best practices and analysis to ensure their
        proper functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role includes overseeing and controlling changes, ensuring code
        quality, and maintaining the appropriate structure for different
        projects according to their requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I am responsible for creating the frameworks for new
        projects. I also provide support to front-end developers in project
        implementation, resolving conflicts, troubleshooting errors, and
        offering knowledge on specific features.
